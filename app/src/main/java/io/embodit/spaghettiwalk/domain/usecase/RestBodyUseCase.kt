/**
 * Keeps the instrument body on the viewer's side of real surfaces: when its designed place would put
 * it into a table top, the floor or a wall, it rests on that surface instead of sinking into it.
 *
 * For every recognised plane that has the head at least 5 cm on one side, and whose quad grown by
 * 15 cm contains the foot point of the body centre: the centre must be at least `s + 3 cm` from the
 * plane on the head's side, where `s` is the half extent of the body's bounding box along the plane
 * normal. If it is not, the centre moves along the normal by the deficit (at most three passes over
 * the planes). If that brings the centre nearer than 0.35 m to the head, it slides along that plane,
 * straight away from the head's foot point, until it is 0.35 m away.
